# BitBurner Scripts For Old Bald Nerds.
a collection of my bitburner scripts.  

ok, i get it... not super tidy, not super efficient.  
It runs. it doesnt crash for no reason. BUT... Some minor human interaction required as the mood adjusts.  
not ALL scripts can see what the other is doing so some priority enabling will still be manually required at THIS stage.  
- BasicHack.js - standard viral payload. hacks, grows and weakens.  
- hacknet_monitor.js - Monitors and autobuys hacknet upgrades. RUN THIS FIRST on each run!! $$$$ maker  
- server_hack_monitor - Monitors the autohacking and penetration of servers in the seen list.  
( cannot currently autobuy/learn programs. manual attainment still at this stage. )  
- server_upgrade_monitor - Upgrades and monitors purchased attack servers, buying them for each hacked server to target them with the prefix "mk_"  
  
Suggestions:  
run hacknet, then server_hack. Wait til hacknet generation is 5k/sec. disable and turn on server_upgrade until all servers currently hackable are upgrade to basic tier. then reenable hacknet. all should run automagically from there.  
  
ToDo:  
- factions/augs
- faction grinding/working to match hack level detection
- stocks. ( in beta... it works. JUST. and needs HEAVY monitoring or it'll eat your profits. )
